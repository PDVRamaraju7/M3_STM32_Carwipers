# WORKING PRINCIPLE:
* Assume that the automobile is the microcontroller. If the button is hit, the first led (red) will turn on, Clicking again the wiper will start, and the second led (blue) will turn on for a desired rate. If the button is pressed again, the third led (green) will turn on, and the wiper's speed will be increased in comparison to the previous one. The fourth press will turn on the fourth led (orange), and the wiper speed will be increased in accordance with the previous one. The microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off after the fifth click.


# FEATURES:

1. It will lock the vehicle when the button is squeezed once
2. It will open the vehicle when the button is squeezed two times
3. It will wiper on and it moves clock wise bearing and when the button is squeezed threefold
4. It will wiper off and it moves hostile to clock wise heading and when the button is squeezed multiple times
5. It will wiper complete one cycle when the button is squeezed multiple times.
6. Up to 1 Mbyte of Flash memory.
7. Up to 192+4 Kbytes of SRAM including 64-Kbyte of CCM (core coupled memory) data RAM.
8. 512 bytes of OTP memory.
9. Flexible static memory controller supporting Compact Flash, SRAM, PSRAM, NOR and NAND memories.

# ADVANTAGES:
* To save money during wet seasons, turn off the irrigation system. Electricity bills are lowered as a consequence.
* Rain sensors store water during rain events, allowing it to be available throughout the summer and winter.
* As a consequence, rain sensor-based equipment like vehicle wipers and irrigation systems last longer since they only work when needed.
* It is quite simple to use.
* As a consequence, less energy is consumed.
* Rain sensor-based systems are extremely simple to install.
* Individual rain sensors are fairly inexpensive.

# Disadvantages:
* When water falls squarely on the rain sensor, the mechanism activates.
* The entire system cost rises when more components, including a rain sensor, are required.
* Rain sensors must make a decision within a few minutes to avoid erroneous detection of rain.
